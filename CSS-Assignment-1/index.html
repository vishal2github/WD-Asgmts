    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><del>CSS is not necessary.</del><mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <br>
        <li><em><u>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</u></em></li>
    </ol>

    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Inline: by using the style attribute inside HTML elemetns.</li>
        <li>Internal: by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External: by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b><mark style="color: brown;">in this tutorial, we will use inline and internal styles,</mark></b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, on the ohter hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also speical in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it is used by JavaScript.</p>

    <p class="p2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style of set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

    <p class="p3"> <i>There is a wide range of selectors avialable. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</i></p>
