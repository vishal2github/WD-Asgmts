    <h1> Backtracking</h1>
    <p>
        Backtracking is a form of recursion.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The usual scenario iss that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you
        make your
        choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This
        procedure is repeated over nad over until you reach a final state,If you made a good sequence of choices, your
        final state
        is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,
        though it may be
        that the leaves are all good or all bad.You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root,
        you choose
        one of its children to move to, nad you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Suppose you get a to bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking uour most
        recent choice,
        and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you
        here, and
        try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be
        found.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> This needs an example:</p>
    <br>

    <img src="images/Image_root.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A. </li><br>
        <li> At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br>
        <li> C is bad.Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
        <li> D is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
        <li> Eis good Congratutions!</li><br>
        <br>
    </ol>

    <div>
        In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices
        we could
        make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what
        choices we have.(If we do have an actual tree data structure, Backtracking on it is called depth-first tree
        searching.)
    </div>

    <h2>The Backtracking Algroithm</h2>
    <br>
    <pre style="color: rgb(3, 148, 245);">
    boolean solve(Node n)
    {
        if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }
        else{
            for each child c of n{
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
        }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
        Notice that the algroithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algroithm.
        If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path form
        the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes
        n to any goal node.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>How does this work?</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li> If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable</li>
        <li> If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do
        is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code,
        this is done by the lines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre style="color: rgb(7, 153, 250);">
    for each child c of n
    {
        if solve(c) succeeds, return true
    }
    return false
</pre>
    <p>
        Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node.It is solvable;
        If the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above, this is done
        by the lines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre style="color: rgb(7, 153, 250);">
    if n is a leaf node{
        if the leaf is a goal node, return true
        else return false
    }
</pre>
    <p>
        The Backtracking algroithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of Stating
        it is as follows:
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3> To search a tree:</h3>
    <ol type="" 1>
        <li> If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
        <li> Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have
            searched them all unsucessfully.
        </li>

    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3> Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a
            stack algorithm.
            In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre style="color: rgb(7, 153, 250);">
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            put node n on the stack;
            while the stack is not empty {
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
            if it is a goal node, return true
            else pop it off the stack
            }
            else {
            if the node at the top of the stack has untried children push the next untried child onto the stack else pop the node off the stack
            return false
            }
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently
        on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time;
        hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack
        only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets
        removed (making the stack empty),
        there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
    </p>
    <div>
        <p>
            When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from
            the root to a goal
            node.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse
            order) in the sequence of recursive calls.
            Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the
            node at the current level, or storing it in an array.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along
            the successful path:
        </p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <pre style="color: rgb(7, 153, 250);">
    boolean solve(Node n) {
        if n is a leaf node {
        if the leaf is a goal node{
        print n
        return true
        }
        else return false
        } else {
        for each child c of n {
        if solve(c) succeeds {
        print n
        return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
    }


</pre>
    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem,
            they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the
            checkmate and stalemate
            solutions
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for
            example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a gameOver method (or you could even call it
            isLeaf).
            This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which
            of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again).
            In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying for each child c of n. In reality, it may be
            difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through
            them.
            In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of
            that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move.
            How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon
            initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children.
            As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried
            children, and you can return "failure."
            This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the
            children.
            If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            For example, you might be able to number the children 1 through n, and try them in numerical order. Then, if
            you have just tried
            child k, you know that you have already tried children 1 through k-1, and you have not yet tried children
            k+1 through n.
            Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try red first, then yellow, then
            green, then blue.
            If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in
            the order left, straight,
            right (or perhaps north, east, south, west).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>

            It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game
            example, you might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order;
            sbut in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We
            will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can
            reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children.
            The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or
            more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles.
            For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node
            might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name.
            The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <pre style="color: rgb(7, 108, 241);">
        public class BinaryTree{
            BinaryTree left child =null;
            BinaryTree right child= null;
            boolean is GoalNode=false;
            String name;

            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree Right, boolean GoalNode)
            {
                this.name=Name;
                leftChild= left;
                rightChild= right;
                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
            }
        }

    </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which construct the
            above Binary Tree.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre style="color: rgb(7,108, 241);">
        static BinaryTree make Tree()
        {
            BinaryTree root,a,b,c,d,e,f;
            c=new BinaryTree("C",null,null,false);
            d= new BinaryTree("D",null,null,false);
            e= new BinaryTree("E",null,null,true);
            f= new BinaryTree("F",null,null,true);
            a= new BinaryTree("A",c,d,false);
            b= new BinaryTree("B",e,f,false);
            root= new BinaryTree("Root",a,bfalse);
                 return root;
        }

    </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to"solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.

    <h3> What are the children?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore
            all the previous choices.
            Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the
            left and the right child are possible solutions.
            In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a
            plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are,
            can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the same color.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on,
            until all countries are colored.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            There are two ways to do this:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you
            are at a goal node.
        </p>
        <p>
            Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and
            when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard.
            This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.

            The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge
            difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth.
            Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential
            growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically
            guaranteed.
            If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!

    <h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes
            we need to fall back on inserting print statements.
            There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements.These tricks can be applied to any
            program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
        </p>
    </div><br>
    <h3> Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important
            ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it
            leaves with.
            However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding
            entries.Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
        </p>
    </div><br>
    <h3>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging
            purposes can itself contain bugs,
            or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p>
        <p>
            Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code,
            but in larger programs
            the properties will be better.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre style="color: rgb(7, 108, 241);">
        static String indent="";
        static String name(BinaryTree node)
        {
            if(node==null)
            return null;
            else return node.name;
        }
        static void enter(BinaryTree node)
        {
            System.out.println(indent+" Entering solvable("+name(node)+")");
            indent = indent+"|";
        }
        static boolean yes (BinaryTree node)
        {
          indent= indent.substring(3);
          System.out.println(indent+ "solvable("+name(node)+") returns true");
          return true;
        }
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node)
        {
            indent = indent.substring(3);
            System.out.println(indent +"solvable(" + name(node)+")returns false");
                return false;
        }
    </pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p> To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
    <div>

        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node)
        {
            enter(node);
            if(node== null) return no(node);
            if(node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
            if(solvable(node.leftChild))return yes(node);
            if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes (node);
            return no(node);
        }
</pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p> And we get these results:</p>
        <p> Entering solvable(Root)</p>
        <p>| Entering solvable(A)</p>
        <p>|| Entering solvable(C)</p>
        <p>||| Entering solvable(null)</p>
        <p>||| solvable(null) return false</p>
        <p>||| Entering solvable(null)</p>
        <p>|||solvable(null) returns false</p>
        <p>|| solvable(C) returns false</p>

        <p>||| Entering solvable(null)</p>
        <p>||| solvable(null) returns false</p>
        <p>||| Entering solvable(null)</p>
        <p>||| solvable(null) returns false</p>
        <p>|| solvable(D) returns false</p>
        <p>| solvable(A) returns false</p>
        <p>| Entering solvable(B)</p>
        <p>|| Entering solvable(E)</p>
        <p>|| solvable(E) returns true</p>
        <p>| solvable(B) returns true</p>
        <p> solvable (Root) returns true</p>
        <p> true</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3> Trick#3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements
            as it is to debug the actual program.
            Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit
            (or to turn over to your manager).
            You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above
            example, you would have to replace every return(yes (node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node))
            with return false.
            With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre style="color: rgb(7, 108, 241);">
        static final boolean debugging= false;
        static void enter(BinaryTree node)
        {
            if(debugging)
            {
                System.out.prinlt(indent+ "Entering solvable(" + name(node)+")");
                indent = indent+"|";

            }
        }
        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node)
        {
            if(debugging)
            {
                indent=indent.substring(3);
                System.out.println(indent+"solvable("+name(node)+") return true");

            }
            return true;
        }
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node)
        {
            if(debugging)
            {
                indent=indent.substring(3);
                System.out.println(indent+"solvable("+name(node)+") return false");

            }
            return false;
        }
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging.
            Don't worry too much about making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable
            debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3> Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>
    <p>
        If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message
        printStackTrace(PrintStream).
        Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. However, Java
        programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it.
        For example, the following code
    </p>
    <div>
        <pre style="color: rgb(7, 108, 241);">
        new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
    </pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally.
            That is, the above code just acts like a print statement.

        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <pre style="color: rgb(7, 108, 241);">

        <li> Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>

            The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether
            we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible.
            This isn't so easy.

            Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to
            attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path,
            or it will fail, and the main program will have to
            print out the bad news.

                Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children
                of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position),
                we need only find the possible moves from that node.Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an
                ordering on these possible moves.

                Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent.
                Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out.
                If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it
                cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible
                moves,
                we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the
                marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of
                where each
                marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to
                find the marble we want.Neither alternative is very attractive.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of
                talking about moving a
                particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from
                a given space, then that
                must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is
                unique. There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble,
                but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of
                the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible.
                With this understanding,we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which
                determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
            </p>
        </div>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
            <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
            <li> If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <p>
                We write another method int[] makeMove (int[] oldBoard, int position) that will take a board and a
                position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board.
                (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new
                one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.)
                In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."

        <div>

                Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that
                should be obvious.

                Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right,
                as in the last line.
                I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always
                produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order;
                it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct order.
